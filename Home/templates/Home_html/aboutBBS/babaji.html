            <p>
              What is Shri Mourya, (Baba) as an artist? His personality may be better highlighted if we ask the question, what he is not….and, to call Baba an artist grossly falls short of the sum total of his personality as it fails to capture the subtle nuances of his reflective, creative and expressive personality.
            </p>
            <p>
              To my mind, to sum it up in one sentence, instead of being a disciple of one art, for the sake of being an artist, he is an artist of pure expression. He uses not just one, but any art that is the right medium to express his particular inner reflection as creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creative personality of this young artist eludes the norms of usual expression in the intellectual and creative field of art. Baba is such a charismatic artist of expression that unless one has seen and known him, it is hard to fathom the expanse of his works. In the field of arts if one were to ask the question as to what he is, it may be easier to describe as to what he is not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Babaji was born with a humble background in a small town called Rajgarh, in the state of Madhya Pradesh, in India in the year 1965. His father was a primary school teacher and Babaji was mostly on his own to fend for his education through ‘earn and learn’ from a very young age. This was partly responsible for developing his multifaceted skills. In short, Babaji is an artist in the truest of senses, as a poet, a performer, an orator, a singer and a painter. Let us explore his different facets.

            <h4>Baba as Poet</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Ji spent a long time as a theatrical poet on various platforms. He was a favorite of audiences because of his unique and various styles and flavours.
            </p>
            <p>
              While he became favourite among those who appreciated his original and clear views, some opponents also criticized him. Not only did Baba Ji infuse his poems with nationalism, but he also mentored a series of new poets who are still flourishing on various forums. Baba Ji created many political and timely parodies that made waves on many stages. His many compositions are still inspiring people. Many poems and songs of Baba Ji have taken musical forms as cassettes.

            <h4>Baba Ji – an Illustrator</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Mourya was attracted to drawing since his childhood, but since there was no provision for artwork education at Rajgadh, Baba Ji graduated in Commerce. Later, he earned his M.A. in painting from Ujjain University. He has a penchant for various styles of painting, but Baba Ji is different from today’s artists, whose art is dependent on galleries. Baba Ji’s canvas is so large that it extends to the walls of forester villages, rail coaches, mandirs, books, and up to the houses and platforms of many countries beyond the seven seas. Baba Ji’s painting does not satisfy the false ego of the wealthy, but gives voice to a meaningful movement, raises dormant emotions, and inspires the viewer on a journey.

            <h4>Baba Ji as Cartoonist</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Ji is often introduced as a cartoonist because of his acute paintings, clear thinking, and sharp views. It was not possible for the newspapers to handle his sharp critiques, so he expressed these subjects himself in small booklets, which were published many times in the millions. Some newspapers and magazines eventually published them in series. Some institutions also exhibited them.

            <h4>Baba Ji as a Cultural Ambassador</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Ji doesn’t go to foreign countries as just an artist, the glory of Bhartiya culturealso goes with him, which is a compulsory part of his lifestyle.  He presents this authentic self to everyone, from the common man to top political and social personalities. Baba Ji forcefully puts forth the side of Bhartiya culture all over the world and presents his exhibitions, programs, and interviews in the same manner. In his travels, he is fulfilling his dharma by spreading yoga, art, Hindi, and religious beliefs.

            <h4>Baba Ji – A Revolutionary Personality</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Satyanarayan Mourya is loved and respected by common men to the most recognized people in the society, but when he is asked about it, he says the biggest official prize is that I am able to move freely. Sant Kabirdas said whoever can shun his house and comforts can join with me.Baba Ji goes one step ahead and says why do something for which you are afraid. If I don’t have a house, opponents won’t be able to burn it. Many Sadhu Sant and poets start movements, advocating for independent thinking, but get tied up with their Ashrams and institutions and forget about promoting truth to mass audiences. That’s why Baba Ji did not bother to build any Ashram and did not desire to receive any prize from the government. While many Sants and writers today are infatuated with the yearning of official recognition and religious positions, Baba is roaring like a lion with the truth that he shares on various platforms and his writings. Sometimes, it appears that Baba Ji supports a political party, but it is not so. No political party supports him fully and Baba Ji does not want to split his personality and dilute his message.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Baba Ji is not tied to the formalities of any sect, his lifestyle always reflects a pure Bhartiya essence, devoid of any material attachment. Baba Ji is a watchman of culture but does not hesitate to attack the rotten beliefs of yesteryears. No one can escape the effectual verbal arrows of Baba, be it a religious personality, a politician, or rich businessman, because Baba lives a life like a gypsy and selfless rebellion. He is his own master that does not need any certificate to prove his sovereignty.

            <h4>Baba Ji as Media Artist</h4>
            <p>
              Having associated with the stage and acting since his student life, Baba Ji wrote some plays that were staged at various celebrated halls of Mumbai. He also taught children in some schools. Later on, he worked at Zee TV for a long time as script writer, director, set designer, programmer, and coordinator. During this time, he wrote various screenplays and wrote some songs that were broadcasted in various programmes. Suresh Wadkar, Sonu Nigam, Annu Kapoor, and Arvind Singh, etc. gave their voices to Baba Ji’s songs. He gave regular structure to Sant discourses in TV programmes and started Jagran and Bhakti Bhav episodes that other channels not only adopted, but eventually spun off into standalone channels dedicated to Dharma. Later looking for freedom to express his views, he got directly associated with theatrical programmes.

            <h4>Baba Ji – in different language, garb, and surrounding</h4>
            <p>
              The important thing about Baba Ji is that he is never considered an outsider, no matter where he goes in Bharat or otherparts of the world. He has given the message of Vasudev Kutumbakam and oneness. People of all ages, clans, sects, or areas, even where not everyone is accepted easily, are attracted to Baba ji’s message, as he has grown up with and embodies the ethos of these common folk. People of other countries and religions also feel ease with him. The belief systems of Bharat that are an innate part of Baba Ji make everyone comfortable with him.

            <h4>Baba Ji – Everywhere</h4>
            <p>
              Baba Ji is not tied to any preconceived mold. He feels at home, be it the simplicity of a village life, modernness of abroad, from the playing fieldto the beaches, from domestic work to technology, or from Yoga to the subjects of modern students. It seems strange to see the same personality speaking on Dharma to humor and satire. It’s difficult to recognize him from his outer look, because there are many personalities mixed in one individual. Sometimes when Baba Ji is playing with children, people ask him where he can be found!
